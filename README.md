ANDROID:
The character is controlled using the accelerometer on the mobile device. By tilting the phone in a leftwards direction, the character moves left and by tilting the phone in a rightwards direction, the character moves right. The player can tap on the screen to shoot. If the character collects an ammo pack dropped from enemies extra ammo is acquired. You can pause the game at any time by swiping down anywhere on the screen, and resume the game by swiping up. To replay you can swipe right, and to exit the application swipe left.

# Gestures identified
TThe gestures control all forms of navigation, UI and game mechanics. The user experience was kept in mind while deciding on and incorporating these gestures into the application.
